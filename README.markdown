Introduction
------------

It's a well-known fact that every request for an asset on your HTML page
increases the loading time, as even with unlimited bandwidth, there's
increased latency for making the request, waiting for the server to process it
and to send the data back.

So by now it has become good practice to, in production mode, send out all
assets (assets being JavaScript and CSS in the course of this description)
together in one big file.

Various approaches have been used for this so far, the most common ones are
these:

* Using some sort of Makefile or similar process, collect the assets, combine
them and then link them. This works very nicely, but the additional deployment
step is easily forgotten and even if you recompile the assets, old versions of
the compiled file could (and should!) be stored in the clients cache.

* Serving all assets together using a specially created gateway script. This
allows you to forego the compilation process, but you have to be very careful
not to break client side caching when you use any server side scripting
language.

  Additionally, by serving assets via your application server, you tie up web
server processes much better used for handling dynamic data.

Both solutions also require you to keep them in mind during development: The
first one requires you to check for the existence of the compiled file and
serve that or the individual files while the second one forces you to do some
kind of registry to notify the central asset serving script about the
whereabouts of the file.

Smarty Asset Compiler (*sacy*) is (as the name suggests) a Plugin for the
widely used PHP templating engine [Smarty](http://www.smarty.net) (sacy works
in both Smarty2 and Smarty3) that provides a fresh approach and solves
(nearly) all problems with the traditional solutions.

Usage
-----

Let's assume that you have an HTML header that looks like this:

    <html>
        <head>
          <title>Title</title>
          <link type="text/css" rel="stylesheet" href="/styles/file1.css" />
          <link type="text/css" rel="stylesheet" href="/styles/file2.css" />
          <link type="text/css" rel="stylesheet" href="/styles/file3.css" />
          <link type="text/css" rel="stylesheet" href="/styles/file4.css" />
          <script type="text/javascript" src="/jslib/file1.js"></script>
          <script type="text/javascript" src="/jslib/file2.js"></script>
          <script type="text/javascript" src="/jslib/file3.js"></script>
        </head>
        <body>
        content
        </body>
    </html>

and let's further assume that these CSS files exists and you want to have them
compiled into one, if possible.

If so, place the sacy plugin file in your Smarty plugin folder and change your
HTML to look like this:

    <html>
        <head>
          <title>Title</title>
          {asset_compile}
              <link type="text/css" rel="stylesheet" href="/styles/file1.css" />
              <link type="text/css" rel="stylesheet" href="/styles/file2.css" />
              <link type="text/css" rel="stylesheet" href="/styles/file3.css" />
              <link type="text/css" rel="stylesheet" href="/styles/file4.css" />
              <script type="text/javascript" src="/jslib/file1.js"></script>
              <script type="text/javascript" src="/jslib/file2.js"></script>
              <script type="text/javascript" src="/jslib/file3.js"></script>
          {/asset_compile}
        </head>
        <body>
        content
        </body>
    </html>

At request time, sacy will parse the content of the block, extract the CSS
links and script tags sourcing files from the same server, and check whether
it has already cached the compiled version.

If not, it'll create one directly on the file system. Note that this process
can take a long time as all sourced files are Minified (using jsMin or
uglyfier for JavaScript and Minify for CSS) before being stored.

At any rate, it'll remove the old `<link>`- and `<script>`-tags and add new
ones, so that your HTML will look like this:

    <html>
        <head>
          <title>Title</title>
          <link type="text/css" rel="stylesheet" href="/assetcache/file1-file2-file3-file4-abc1234def12345.css" />
          <script type="text/javascript" src="/assetcache/file1-file2-file3-deadbeef1234.js"></script>
        </head>
        <body>
        content
        </body>
    </html>

sacy takes into account the media attribute for CSS files and only groups
links together if they share the same media attribute. The reason for this is
that you probably do not want your print-style intermixed with your screen
style.

This also means though, that to achieve the optimum performance, you should
group links with the same media attribute together:

    {asset_compile}
        <link type="text/css" media="screen" rel="stylesheet" href="/styles/file1.css" />
        <link type="text/css" media="print" rel="stylesheet" href="/styles/file2.css" />
        <link type="text/css" media="screen" rel="stylesheet" href="/styles/file3.css" />
        <link type="text/css" media="screen" rel="stylesheet" href="/styles/file4.css" />
    {/asset_compile}

will produce

    <link type="text/css" media="screen" rel="stylesheet" href="/csscache/file1-hash.css" />
    <link type="text/css" media="print" rel="stylesheet" href="/csscache/file2-hash.css" />
    <link type="text/css" media="screen" rel="stylesheet" href="/csscache/file2-file3-hash.css" />

whereas a bit of reordering to

    {asset_compile}
        <link type="text/css" media="screen" rel="stylesheet" href="/styles/file1.css" />
        <link type="text/css" media="screen" rel="stylesheet" href="/styles/file3.css" />
        <link type="text/css" media="screen" rel="stylesheet" href="/styles/file4.css" />
        <link type="text/css" media="print" rel="stylesheet" href="/styles/file2.css" />
    {/asset_compile}

will cause only two links to be created:

    <link type="text/css" media="screen" rel="stylesheet" href="/csscache/file1-file3-file4-hash.css" />
    <link type="text/css" media="print" rel="stylesheet" href="/csscache/file2-hash.css" />

Same, by the way, goes for intermixing css and javascript references because
it's possible that javascript code might depend on something that was set in
an earlier CSS file.

So for maximum efficiency, group javascript and CSS file together and don't
switch media types around between two link tags.

sacy will ignore all referenced resources if the given URL-string contains a
scheme and/or a host name.

While PHP's built-in support for networking protocols would allow for the
handling of remote files, in most of the cases this is **not** what the user
expects (think "ad-tracking code"). If you need this feature, you will
have to patch sacy accordingly, but keep in mind that checking the
last-modified-date of remote resources is very costly and possibly
inaccurate.

Also, remote resources can change at will, which would cause the whole cache
file to be regenerated way too often.

Improved CSS Language transformations
-------------------------------------

By now, you will probably have heard of either [less](http://lesscss.org/) or
[sass](http://sass-lang.com/) and you might want to use them for your projects
as they really go a long ways in making your life easier.

Sacy has built-in support to do such transformations if it finds (see below)
[lessphp](http://leafo.net/lessphp) or [PHamlP](http://code.google.com/p/phamlp/)
for CSS or [coffeescript-php](https://github.com/alxlit/coffeescript-php)
loaded or you provide it with paths to the respective official tools
(also, see below)

Inside an `{asset_compile}` tag, just link to these files, or write inline code
like so:

    {asset_compile}
    <link type="text/x-sass" rel="stylesheet" href="/styles/style.sass" />
    <link type="text/x-scss" rel="stylesheet" href="/styles/style.scss" />
    <link type="text/x-less" rel="stylesheet" href="/styles/style.less" />
    <script type="text/coffeescript" src="/jslib/file.coffee"></script>

    <script type="text/coffeescript">
    fun = (a)->
      alert "Hello #{a}"
    fun "World"
    </script>

    {/asset_compile}

Sacy uses the mime-types you provide with the type attribute to invoke the
correct transformer before writing the file to the cache.

#### Note

In general, it's not good practice to use inline `script`- or `style`-tags, so
it's recommended you use this feature (as of 0.4) of sacy sparingly. It can
still be useful though if you have to pass data from smarty through to the JS
layer and you'd like to use coffee script for that too.

You would also get free minification of course.

See below for some information about dependencies and how to bundle them.

Advantages
----------

* **ease of use**: with sacy, you do not have to change your templates to make
the caching work. It'll work in the background and do its stuff

* **correct caching**: Your compiled CSS is written to the disk the web server
is using, thus you can offload all the work needed for correct client-side
caching (ETag, If-Modified-Since, and so on) to the webserver which should
already be king at doing just that.

  Also, it keeps serving assets away from your application server (be it
Apache behind a reverse proxy or FastCGI), saving you lots of RAM.

* **efficiency**: The static file will be directly sent over by your webserver.
No need to hit PHP or any other processor to render the CSS - heck you could
even configure sacy to place the compiled file on a different server used for
serving just static content.

* **automatically up-to-date**: Because a new static file is generated
whenever your assets change, you'll never have to worry about convincing
clients that the files have changed. Even if one CSS-file of the compilation
changed, the URL will change completely and will cause the clients to
request the new file

* **ease of development**: You can keep all assets in non-minified development
form to work with them. You can even disable the plugin and have the assets
included the traditional way during development, leaving you with all the
methods for debugging you would want.

Features
--------

There are other solutions for this around, but sacy has a few really unique
features:

* **Transformations**: Sacy can transform less, sass, scss and coffee script
files for you without making you remember to run deployment scripts or
keeping an additional daemon running that recompiles stuff.

* **Fallback**: If at any time there is an issue in generating the cached
copy, sacy will not alter the existing link tags. Sure: More requests will
be sent to the server, but nothing will break.

* **Concurrency**: If two requests come in at the same time and the cache-file
does not exist, sacy will neither create a corrupted cache file, *nor will
it block* any request. Any request being processed while the cache is being
written will have the individual links in the code. Any subsequent request
will link to the compiled file.

* **Being Helpful**: The unique name of the cache file contains the base names
of the CSS files used to create the compilation which helps you to debug
this quickly. If you look inside the file, you'll find a list of the full
path names (minus the `DOCUMENT_ROOT` as to not expose private data)

* **url()-rewriting**: If you are using relative urls in your css files, they
would break if they are used in css-files in hierarchies deeper than what
sacy exposes. This would cause background images not to load and lots of
other funny mistakes. Thus, sacy looks at the CSS files and tries to rewrite
all url()'s it finds using information from `ASSET_COMPILE_URL_ROOT` to
point to the correct files again. This is now done by Minify which is
included in the package.

* **inline tags** since version 0.4, sacy supports transforming tags with
inline content. This means that you can now have coffee-script and sass or
all other types supported by sacy directly inside your page. While not
recommended practice, sometimes, you need to pass data from smarty to the
JS code and it would be cool to use coffee there too!

Notes about inline tags
-----------------------
Because the the inline script passed into sacy inherently changes depending
on its input and because you can nest smarty code inside such inline scripts,
sacy has to hash the whole untransformed inlined code before it can check
whether it already has transformed that specific piece of code.

This costs (comparatively) more performance than simply check a file for its
last modification time, so using sacy to deal with inlined code segments is
potentially slower than using it with external files (which is the
recommended practice anyways).


Installation
------------

Make sure that you define two constants somewhere before {asset_compile}
is evaluated the first time:

`ASSET_COMPILE_OUTPUT_DIR` is the filesystem path where you want the
files written to.

`ASSET_COMPILE_URL_ROOT` is how that directoy is accessible
as an URL relative to the server root.

It's recommended to set `OUTPUT_DIR` to some place that's not publicly
accessible and then using symlinks or a webserver level alias directory to
make just that directory accessible to the outside. You do not want
world-writable directories exposed more than what's absolutely needed.


Building sacy
-------------

Let's say you want to create one single smarty plugin file (for easy
deployment) that contains all dependencies for both minification and
transformation.

Using the power of PHP 5.3's phar module you can do that using the
`build.php` script that comes with the sacy source code.

build.php is going to write a phar file, so you need to have phar write
support enabled in your php.ini (set `phar.readonly` to off). Then you
can execute the build script from the command line.

It supports the following parameters:

`-c` will add CSSMin to the bundle

`-j` will add JSMin support into the bundle

Note that CSSMin is required by all means for sacy to work. If you
decide not to bundle it, that means that you need to have it available
and loaded somewhere else or sacy will blow up.

JSMin is optional if you use an external processor, but in general, sacy won't
work without any means for CSS- and JS minification (which was its initial
purpose).

Then, the script has two more optional parameters:

`--with-phamlp=<dir>`: pass the path to the extracted source code archive of
PHamlP. This will enable sacy to transform both sass and scss files. The
currently released phamlp has [an issue with @import](http://code.google.com/p/phamlp/issues/detail?id=116)
- the build script patches the library accordingly

`--with-lessphp=<dir>`: pass the path to the extracted source code archive of
lessphp. This will enable sacy to transform less files.

`--with-coffeescript-php=<dir>`: pass the path to the extracted source code
repository clone of coffeescript-php (https://github.com/alxlit/coffeescript-php).
If you provide this, sacy will transform coffee script files to javascript
for you.

As before: If you don't bundle these three but you have them loaded somewhere
before sacy is used, then sacy will use your already loaded copy to do
the thing.

After the script has run, you will find the compiled

`block.asset_compile.php` in the `build/` subdirectory. Place that (yes
just that one file) in your smarty plugins directory and you're done.

You can provide a `-o` parameter to `build.php` to have
`block_asset_compile.php` written in another directory of your choice.

If you use `-z g` or `-z b`, the files inside the archive will be compressed
using either gzip (g) or bzip2 (b). Be mindful though that for such a .phar
file to be usable, the target machine needs the corresponding compression
extension to be loaded.

**Note:** If you indend to use the official, external tools instead of the PHP
ports (see below), you don't have to include any of the PHP native tools into
the bundle (aside of CSSMin for which there are no external replacements)

Configuration
--------------

### Block parameters

´{asset_tag}´ supports three parameters:

- `query_strings = ("ignore"|"force-handle")`

  Specifies how sacy should handle relations that contain query-strings
  in their location:

  "ignore" will decline handling tags whose locations contain query strings

  "force-handle" will handle them.

  "ignore" is the default.

- `write_headers = (true|false)`

 Specifies whether sacy should write a header enumerating the source files
 into the compiled files (it will never expose the DOCUMENT_ROOT though).

 This can be helpful for debugging purposes, but one might want to turn
 it off for file size reasons (ridiculous considering the size of the headers)
 or to not expose information.

 true is the default, so headers are written

- `debug_toggle = (<string>|false)`

 If `$_GET[<debug_toggle>]` or `$_COOKIE[<debug_toggle>]` is set to either
 1 or 2, then the following will happen:

 "1" will make sacy decline all processing of a blocks content.

 "2" will make sacy re-process all files as if the cache was empty.

 "3" will make sacy only do transformations (less, sass, scss), but leave
 all other files alone and write one output file per input.
 Use this for development.

 debug_toggle is set to `_sacy_debug` per default. If it's set to `false` sacy
 will never do any debug handling regardless of the request.

If you want to specify a default value for all tags on a page, you can define
SACY_(any of the above in uppercase) before you use the tag the first time.
In that case, the value of your define() will be used as default.

Example:

    define(SACY_WRITE_HEADERS, false);

Will cause {asset_compile} without parameters not to emit the headers.

### Fragment cache configuration

In order to correctly deal with inline tags (`<style>`...`</style>` or
`<script>`..`</script>` tags not referring to an external resource), sacy
needs read/write access to a fragment cache where it stores the output of its
transformation under a key derived by hashing the original tag contents.

By default, sacy uses a very trivial filesystem based cache in a folder called
"fragments" which it auto-creates inside of `ASSET_COMPILE_OUTPUT_DIR`.

If you have a better caching facility you'd like sacy to use, that's fine and
even recommended in order to safe the server a lot of `stat()`-ing.

In order to do that, create a class that implements two methods:

```PHP
<?php
class MyOwnFragmentCache{
  function __construct(){}
  function get($key){}
  function set($key, $value){}
}
?>
```

Key is guaranteed to match `/^[0-9a-z]+$/`. If get returns a value considered
`false` by PHP, sacy assumes a cache miss. The constructor must not require
any arguments.

In order to not mess with Smarty's autoloading of plugins, there's no specific
interface your class has to implement (as that would require you to pre-load
the block plugin in order for PHP to find the interface).

Once that class exists, define `SACY_FRAGMENT_CACHE_CLASS` to the name of
your class:

```PHP
<?php
define('SACY_FRAGMENT_CACHE_CLASS', 'MyOwnFragmentCache');
?>
```

If that define is set, sacy is going to use that class instead of its own
trivial file based cache.


### Tool configuration

By default, sacy will use pure PHP implementations for all of the
transformations it supports. This has the advantage that sacy will work on any
webserver - even on shared hosting environments.

The disadvantage is that you will have to fight with additional bugs that are
specific to the respective PHP ports. It also means that you will lag behind
the latest releases of the various tools (which can be especially annoying for
the transformations like Coffee Script or SASS)

So if you are capable of providing the required dependencies (all of them
require either node.js or ruby to be installed on the machine that sacy runs
on), you can tell sacy to use these.

In order to not hit the file system multiple times per request to check
whether the external tools are available or not, you will have to tell sacy by
define()'ing some constants pointing sacy to the path of the respecive tools:

- `SACY_COMPRESSOR_UGLIFY` specifies the path to a release of uglify-js which
  you can install using `npm install -g uglify-js`. If you do so, uglify is
  likely to be installed in `/usr/local/bin/uglifyjs`.

- `SACY_TRANSFORMER_COFFEE` specifies the path to a release of the
  coffee-script compiler. You can install that using `npm install -g
  coffee-script` and if you do so, you'd likely set this to
  `/usr/local/bin/coffee`

- `SACY_TRANSFORMER_LESS` specifies the path to the less compiler. At this
  time, the latest released version (1.1.4) does not support reading the less
  data from STDIN, so you will have to ask npm to install the git version
  using `npm install -g git://github.com/cloudhead/less.js.git` which will
  make the binary available at `/usr/local/bin/lessc`.

- `SACY_TRANSFORMER_SASS` specifies the path to the sass compiler. This
  requires a working ruby installation (1.8.7 or later) and you would install
  it using `gem install sass`, giving you an executable at `/usr/bin/sass`

- `SACY_TRANSFORMER_ECO` specifies the path to the eco compiler. You can
  install it using `npm install -g eco`, which will likely put the eco
  executable in `/usr/local/bin/eco`.

If you are not sure what you are doing, always install these utilities to
their global locations. If you install them as a user account, chances are
that the user the web server runs as will not be able to find them or if they
do, the tools themselves will probably not find their required libraries.

I'm not saying it's impossible - it's just much harder.

At the moment, CSS minification is done only using the native PHP CSSMin, as
this is as "official" as all the other tools.


### Web servers

Because the name of the generated file changes the moment you change any of
the dependent files, this also means that a web browser or even a proxy server
will never have to re-request a file once it has been downloaded.

To make this perfectly clear to both browsers and proxy-servers, set these the
Expires-header far into the future and set Cache-Control to public so proxies
will cache the file too. This will greatly decrease the load on your server
and the bandwidth consumed.

To do this in Apache, I have used these directives:

    <Location /assetcache>
          ExpiresActive On
          ExpiresDefault "access plus 1 year"
          Header merge Cache-Control public
    </Location>

If you are using nginx, you can accomplish the same thing using

    location /assetcache {
        expires max;
    }

Other browsers will provide similar methods.


Known Issues
------------

* sacy doesn't handle HTML comments (bug #4), so even if a tag is inside HTML
comments, it will still be rendered. Use Smarty comments for now. This also
means that sacy will fail in cases where IE's conditional comments are used to
fetch additional files. For now, put these conditional comments outside of a
`{asset_compile}` tag

* sacy does not contain a CSS parser. It does rewrite any relative url() it
finds inside the CSS-file to absolute ones though, but it does not follow
@import directives. This means that while @import will not break, you will
lose the compilation feature as `@import`ed files get loaded the traditional
way
